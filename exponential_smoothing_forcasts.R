# multiplicative seasonality

##### Holt-Winters method with daily data #####
##### the Holt-Winters method can also be used for daily type of data, where the seasonal period is m=7, and the 
##### appropriate unit of time for h is in days - here, we generate daily forecasts for the last five weeks for the 
##### hyndsight data, which contains the daily pageviews on the Hyndsight blog for one year starting April 30, 2014
fc <- hw(subset(hyndsight,end=length(hyndsight)-35),
